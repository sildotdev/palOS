# PalOS
PalOS is a React app created for [Palomino](https://github.com/sildotdev/palominorp). It implements a Police Computer using [React95](https://github.com/React95/React95).

PalOS depends on [PAPI](https://github.com/sildotdev/papi) and [PAUTH](https://github.com/sildotdev/pauth) to handle API requests and authentication respectively.

# PalOS in action:

The video below shows how PalOS uses PAUTH, a seperate webapp, to handle authentication.
